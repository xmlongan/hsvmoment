# Package hsvmoment

**updates**: This package has been updated and renamed as `ajdmom` with a new repository <https://github.com/xmlongan/ajdmom>. The documentation is hosted on <http://www.yyschools.com/ajdmom>.

With this package, you can calculate any order moment and covariance of 
Heston Stochastic Volatility Model and its derived models. Their partial
derivatives with respect to parameters in the models can also be calculated.
A typical application of the moment (covariance) and their partial 
derivations is to estimate parameters of the models through Method of Moments.
